# ðŸš€ Quick Start
# 1. Install Requirements
     pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install Tesseract OCR
     Download and install from Tesseract OCR UB Mannheim
     Update TESSERACT_CMD path in config/settings.py
3. Start Backend (Vehicle Detection)
    python backend.py
4. Start Streamlit Dashboard
    streamlit run app.py
Backend and Web app should be run in separate terminals.
